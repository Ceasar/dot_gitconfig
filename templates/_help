    # Automatically correct and execute mistyped commands after waiting
    # for the given number of deciseconds (0.1 sec). If more than one
    # command can be deduced from the entered text, nothing will be
    # executed. If the value of this option is negative, the corrected
    # command will be executed immediately. If the value is 0 - the
    # command will be just shown but not executed. This is the default.
